# Advent of Code 2025

This is my repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2025. These are my solutions to the puzzles.

I am working in Rust. I'm not worried about submitting quickly, just enjoying the process of puzzle solving with my merely mortal mind. 

As a rule I will not be using any large language models or relevant AI such as Claude Code or GitHub Copilot. They're great, but they obviate the fundamental intention of this project.
